PYthon Models for AGeNt-based resource GAthering (pyMANGA) is a collection of models describing vegetation population dynamics based on first principles.
pyMANGA is modular and descriptions for individual tree growth, resource availability and competition dynamics can be exchanged rapidly.
Due to its modular structure, the tool box could be applied for various research questions in our [projects](/about/projects/).

Please don't hestitate to get in touch with our [team](/about/team/).
